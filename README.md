# Saurav Kumar - Personal Portfolio

This is a dynamic and responsive personal portfolio website designed to showcase my skills, projects, and professional journey. Built with React.js, it offers a clean, modern design with interactive elements and a seamless user experience across various devices.

## ✨ Features

* **Dynamic Day/Night Theme:** A toggleable theme switcher provides a comfortable viewing experience. Light mode features a soft, animated beige background with inverted colors from the dark mode palette, while dark mode boasts a deep, tech-inspired gradient.
* **Responsive Design:** Optimized for all screen sizes, from mobile devices to large desktops, ensuring a consistent and accessible layout.
* **Intelligent Navbar:**
    * Stays fixed at the top on scroll for easy navigation.
    * Displays a consistent dark gradient background when at the top of the page.
    * Dynamically changes its background color (to match the main page background) when scrolled, adapting to the active theme (beige in light mode, dark in dark mode).
    * Hamburger menu for mobile navigation.
* **Animated Background:** A subtle, moving background effect in light mode adds a touch of dynamism without distraction.
* **Custom Branding:** Features a custom logo in the Navbar and a personalized favicon in the browser tab.
* **Project Showcase:**
    * Displays featured projects in a responsive grid (2x2 on large screens, 1x1 on smaller devices).
    * Project cards include images/videos (properly scaled to avoid distortion), clear titles, technologies used, and full descriptions.
* **Alternate Section Backgrounds:** Visually distinguishes the Resume and Contact sections with alternating background colors based on the active theme.
* **Interactive Skills Section:** Organizes technical skills into categorized tags.
* **Downloadable Resume:** Provides a direct link to download my professional resume (PDF format).
* **Contact Form:** A functional contact form powered by Formspree for easy communication.
* **Smooth Scrolling:** Navigating between sections is smooth and user-friendly.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

* **Frontend:**
    * **React.js:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
    * **JavaScript (ES6+):** For all application logic.
    * **HTML5 & CSS3:** For structuring and styling the web content.
    * **CSS Variables (Custom Properties):** For efficient and manageable theming.
* **Icons:**
    * **Lucide React:** For various interface icons (e.g., GitHub, Mail, Download).
    * **React Icons:** For social media and theme toggle icons (FaMoon, FaSun, FaBars, FaTimes).
* **Backend (for Contact Form):**
    * **Formspree:** A simple service to handle form submissions without server-side code.
